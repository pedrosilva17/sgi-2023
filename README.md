## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- Portal 1 cake room inspired scene

-----

### [TP2 - Darkroom](tp2)

- The scene features a darkroom, a room used for developing camera rolls, with several additional elements in order to populate and meet the projects requirements.

- Strengths
  - Captured the intended atmosphere, of a cozy yet neutral room with some lived in aspects.
  - General creativity with the different tools that are implemented.

- Problems
  - Lack of a well defined data structure, with the necessary adaptations for threejs .
  - Parser was limiting, especially coming from the first project which had allowed for a greater deal of freedom with threejs's tools even if limited by time, requirements and lack of experience.
